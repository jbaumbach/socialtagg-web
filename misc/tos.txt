Examples of SocialTagg Applications include its smart phone applications (SocialTagg for Android or SocialTagg for iPhone), and other interactive plugins distributed on websites across the web. SocialTagg Applications are distinct from third party Platform Applications addressed in Section 4.B.

Further, by importing any of your SocialTagg data through the SocialTagg Application, you represent that you have authority to share the transferred data with your mobile carrier or other access provider. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile account, you must promptly update your SocialTagg account information to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person that acquires your old number and failure to do so is your responsibility. You acknowledge you are responsible for all charges and necessary permissions related to accessing SocialTagg through your mobile access provider. Therefore, you should check with your provider to find out if the Services are available and the terms for these services for your specific mobile devices.

Finally, by using any downloadable application to enable your use of the Services, you are explicitly confirming your acceptance of the terms of the End User License Agreement associated with the application provided at download or installation, or as may be updated from time to time.

j) User-to-User Communication and Sharing 

Please note that ideas you post and information you share may be seen and used by other Users, and SocialTagg cannot guarantee that other Users will not use the ideas and information that you share on SocialTagg. Therefore, if you have an idea or information that you would like to keep confidential and/or don't want others to use, or that is subject to third party rights that may be infringed by your sharing it, do not share it on SocialTagg. SocialTagg IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR A USER'S MISUSE OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION YOU POST IN ANY SocialTagg piece of technology.

k) Privacy.

You should carefully read our full Privacy Policy before deciding to become a User as it is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference, and governs our treatment of any information, including personally identifiable information you submit to us. Please note that certain information, statements, data, and content (such as photographs) which you may submit to SocialTagg, reveal your gender, ethnic origin, nationality, age, and/or other personal information about you. You acknowledge that your submission of any information, statements, data, and content to us is voluntary on your part.

Your use of SocialTagg services, including our software, is subject to export and re-export control laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") maintained by the United States Department of Commerce and sanctions programs maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. You shall not, directly or indirectly, sell, export, re-export, transfer, divert, or otherwise dispose of any software or service to any end-user without obtaining the required authorizations from the appropriate government authorities. You also warrant that you are not prohibited from receiving US origin products, including services or software.

On the condition that you comply with all your obligations under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Do's and Don'ts listed in Section 10, we grant you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive, nonassignable, nonsublicenseable license and right to access the Services, through a generally available web browser, mobile device or application (but not through scraping, spidering, crawling or other technology or software used to access data without the express written consent of SocialTagg or its Users), view information and use the Services that we provide on SocialTagg webpages and in accordance with this Agreement. Any other use of SocialTagg contrary to our mission and purpose (such as seeking to connect to someone you do not trust, or to use information gathered from SocialTagg commercially unless expressly authorized by SocialTagg) is strictly prohibited and a violation of this Agreement. We reserve all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement, including, without limitation, title, ownership, intellectual property rights, and all other rights and interest in SocialTagg and all related items, including any and all copies made of the SocialTagg website.

4) OUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS.

a) Services Availability.

For as long as SocialTagg continues to offer the Services, SocialTagg shall provide and seek to update, improve and expand the Services. As a result, we allow you to access SocialTagg as it may exist and be available on any given day and have no other obligations, except as expressly stated in this Agreement. We may modify, replace, refuse access to, suspend or discontinue SocialTagg, partially or entirely, or change and modify prices for all or part of the Services for you or for all our users in our sole discretion. All of these changes shall be effective upon their posting on our site or by direct communication to you unless otherwise noted. SocialTagg further reserves the right to withhold, remove and or discard any content available as part of your account, with or without notice if deemed by SocialTagg to be contrary to this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, SocialTagg has no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content that you or other Users provide when using the Services.

b) Third Party Sites and Developers.

SocialTagg may include links to third party web sites ("Third Party Sites") on www.socialtagg.com, developer.socialtagg.com, and elsewhere. SocialTagg also enables third party developers ("Platform Developers") to create applications ("Platform Applications") that provide features and functionality using data and developer tools made available by SocialTagg through its developer platform.

You are responsible for evaluating whether you want to access or use a Third Party Site or Platform Application. You should review any applicable terms and/or privacy policy of a Third Party Site or Platform Application before using it or sharing any information with it, because you may give the operator permission to use your information in ways we would not.

SocialTagg is not responsible for and does not endorse any features, content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from Third Party Sites or Platform Applications. SocialTagg also does not screen, audit, or endorse Platform Applications. Accordingly, if you decide to access Third Party Sites or use Platform Applications, you do so at your own risk and agree that your use of any Platform Application is on an "as-is" basis without any warranty as to the Platform Developer's actions, and that this Agreement does not apply to your use of any Third Party Site or Developer Application.

Please note: If you allow a Platform Application or Third Party Site to authenticate to or connect with your SocialTagg account, that application or website can access information on SocialTagg related to you and your connections.

For additional information regarding Platform Developers and Platform Applications, please refer to SocialTagg's Privacy Policy.

c) Disclosure of User Information.

You acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose your registration and any other information you provide if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary in our opinion to: (1) comply with legal process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties, whether or not the third party is a User, individual, or government agency; (4) respond to customer service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of SocialTagg, our Users or the public.

Disclosures of User information to third parties other than those required to provide customer support, administer this agreement, or comply with legal requirements are addressed in the Privacy Policy.

d) Connections and Interactions with other Users.

You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. SocialTagg may limit the number of connections you may have to other Users and may, in certain circumstances, prohibit you from contacting other Users through use of the Services or otherwise limit your use of the Services. SocialTagg reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other members and to restrict, suspend, or close your account if SocialTagg determines, in our sole discretion, that doing so is necessary to enforce this Agreement.

5) DISCLAIMER.

SOME COUNTRIES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED TERMS IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS AND AS A RESULT THE CONTENTS OF THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, ACCURACY OF DATA, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED OR HARMED BY SocialTagg OR ANYTHING RELATED TO SocialTagg, YOU MAY CLOSE YOUR SocialTagg ACCOUNT AND TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 7 ("TERMINATION") AND SUCH TERMINATION SHALL BE YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.

SocialTagg IS NOT RESPONSIBLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES FOR THE DELIVERY OF ANY MESSAGES SENT THROUGH SocialTagg TO ANYONE. IN ADDITION, WE NEITHER WARRANT NOR REPRESENT THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE WILL NOT INFRINGE THE RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.

SocialTagg DOES NOT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSONS SUBSCRIBING TO ITS SERVICES, NOR DOES IT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO MONITOR THE USE OF ITS SERVICES BY OTHER USERS OF THE COMMUNITY; THEREFORE, SocialTagg DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR IDENTITY THEFT OR ANY OTHER MISUSE OF YOUR IDENTITY OR INFORMATION.

Apply regardless of whether (1) you base your claim on contract, tort, statute or any other legal theory, (2) we knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages, or (3) the limited remedies provided in this section fail of their essential purpose; and
Not apply to any damage that SocialTagg may cause you intentionally or knowingly in violation of this Agreement or applicable law, or as otherwise mandated by applicable law that cannot be disclaimed from in this Agreement.

You may terminate this Agreement, for any or no reason, at any time, with notice to SocialTagg pursuant to Section 9.C. This notice will be effective upon SocialTagg processing your notice. SocialTagg may terminate the Agreement and your account for any reason or no reason, at any time, with or without notice.

8) DISPUTE RESOLUTION

a) Law and Forum for Legal Disputes

This Agreement or any claim, cause of action or dispute ("claim") arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California regardless of your country of origin or where you access SocialTagg, and notwithstanding of any conflicts of law principles and the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods. You and SocialTagg agree that all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Los Angeles County, California, except as otherwise agreed by the parties or as described in the Arbitration Option paragraph below. You and SocialTagg agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Los Angeles County, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims. Notwithstanding the above, you agree that SocialTagg shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

b) Arbitration Option.

For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

9) GENERAL TERMS.

a) Severability.

If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be illegal, void, or unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be modified so as to render it enforceable and effective to the maximum extent possible in order to effect the intention of the provision; and if a court or arbitrator finds the modified provision invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be affected in any way.

b) Language.

Where SocialTagg has provided you with a translation of the English language version of this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and/or any other documentation, you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and any other documentation, including additional terms of service for Premium Services, will govern your relationship with SocialTagg.
