      h2 API Documentation
      p Welcome to the SocialTagg API.  The available functions are documented below.  
        | All functions return JSON unless otherwise indicated.  Feel free to email us
        | at 
        a(href='mailto:support@socialtagg.com') support@socialtagg.com 
        | if you have any questions.
      p To authenticate with the API, a custom header should be added to your request.  The
        | header value is a sha256 hash of (your api key + api password + Unix timestamp).
        | Please see the examples below for more details.  (Future: sample code for common
        | platforms)
